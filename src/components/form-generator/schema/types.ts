/**
 * This module contains the types for the building blocks of the
 * schema for the form tree.
 *
 * Form tree has three main types of building blocks: a level, a field
 * and a logical block.
 *
 * Levels are the most basic of concepts. They are defined in the interface `Level`,
 * and essentially represent a `<div>` in the final markup. They can have context to render
 * header/footer and have children, but that's it.
 *
 * Fields are the meat of the schema - those represent an actual input of some kind on the
 * form. Fields are bound to the properties of the model - think of this field as a v-model.
 * Field rendering is defined by the widget property. Any validations for the specified model
 * are also defined here. If multiple fields in the schema point to the same `modelPath`, their
 * validations are collected and merged together, although it is recommended to define all validations
 * on one field in such case - for maintainability.
 *
 * Logical blocks are the most interesting part of the schema - they allow for creation of complex and
 * dynamic layouts. They come in four types: `If`, `Elif`, `Switch` and `For`. First three allow branching
 * or conditional rendering of parts of the schema tree, while `For` gives an ability to render fields
 * for each item of an array of values. All logical blocks are dependent on one field by default. This
 * is by design, as it allows to keep parts of the schema from recalculation.
